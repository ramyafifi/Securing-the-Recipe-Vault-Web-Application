# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Use CloudFront CDN to secure and accelerate access to data.
Use Systems Manager to help maintain security and compliance by scanning instances against patch, configuration, and custom policies. you can define patch baselines, maintain up-to-date anti-virus definitions, and enforce firewall policies. you can also remotely manage your servers at scale without manually logging in to each server. 



# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

With insecure IAM permissions for the S3 bucket, using VPC Private Endpoints would not prevent the unauthorized access to the secret bucket. 



# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

When you enable S3 Bucket Encryption, it does not affect existing objects in your bucket
Therefore, it may be wise to enable encryption prior uploading any files on your S3 bucket



# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

Without updating the original CloudFormation templates with any necessary changes/fixes, applying them would result in reverting back to the original security settings.
